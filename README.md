     ```

2. **Set your web serverâ€™s document root to the `public/` directory.**

3. **Visit the installer:**
   - Go to `http://yourdomain.com/install.php` (or `http://localhost/grievance_system/public/install.php`)
   - Follow the on-screen steps:
     1. Enter database details
     2. Create tables and config
     3. Set up the first super administrator

4. **Register your application in Microsoft Entra** and update `src/sso/microsoft.php` with your credentials.

## After Installation

  ```bash
  rm public/install.php
  rm -rf install
  ```
- **Set config file to read-only:**

  ```
- **(Optional) Set up HTTPS** for secure logins.
- **Log in as super admin and assign roles to users as needed.**
